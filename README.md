An-Improved-LSTM-Model-for- Behavior-Recognition-of-Intelligent-Vehicles
A total of four experiments have done,including:
1.Vehivle behavior recognition experiment based on vehicle behavior data set from Udacity
2.Handwritten digit recognition experiment based on handwritten number
3.Emotion classification based on movie reviewm
4.Next trajectory point regression fitting experiment  based on NGSIM data set.

If you want to know more, please refer to my paper"An Improved LSTM Model for Behavior Recognition of Intelligent Vehicles" for vehicle behavior recognition.
